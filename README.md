### VERSE 1
{Am} Grinding my back {F} teeth {C} down, {G7} wearing at the enamel
{Am} same loop through the {F} house like it'll {C} tire me {G7} out

### VERSE 2
{Am} Missed the {F} train, heard it {C} cry off the bluff, {G7} lying awake  
{Am} Chest full of {F} dead weight, {C} and my head won't shut the fuck{G7} up
{F} Three hours in and {C} I'm bargaining with the {G7} ceiling for one night {Am} without   
{F} the rerun of every {G7} conversation {C} I should've walked {Am} away from   
### BRIDGE
{F} I sink further {C} in the divot {G7} on my side of the {Am} bed  
{F} Counting my pulse {C} against the laugh tracks {G7} laying here {Am} instead  
{F} Eyes on the screen but {C} I'm not even {G7} watching  
### CHORUS 2
{F} Volume up to {C} drown the quiet {G7} out
{F} Trading {C} one noise for {G7} another
{F} Can't remember {C} when I last heard {G7} nothing
{F} Can't hear my {C} own thoughts unless I {G7} say them out loud
